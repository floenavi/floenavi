## Detailed Feature Description

### Map support

Displaying a map image in the app requires two files to be stored in a admin-defined
directory on the SyncServer host.
The directory used for providing those files is configured in the `application.yaml` file with the keyword `maps`

The example `application.yaml` is provided in the [upgrade instructions](UPGRADE.md).

#### 1. The map image file `map.jpg`

  - This must be a standard JPEG file.
The app was tested with a jpg of size 3353x1731 pixel and 4MB.
Images with 12Mpx (4000x3000) or higher should also be possible.
  - The position of the origin and x-axis station need to be manually locatable on the image.

![Beispielkarte](map/map.jpg)

The origin stations is AIDAperla (red dot at Steinwerder Quay, right of center), 
the x-axis station is Europa2 (red dot at hamburg cruise center, center and top border).

#### 2. The image configuration file `map.info`

  - The pixel coordinates of the two stations need to be specified

Example content of the file:

```
origin 2300 681
x-axis 1774 201
```

  - origin is at x=2300, y=681
  - x-axis is at x=1774, y=201
  
The position `x=0`, `y=0` is the top-left corner of the image

#### 3. Disabling the map image

  - Remove the files from the map directory on the SyncServer
  - Perform a sync (download) from the SyncServer

If there is no image in the map directory on the SyncServer, the map image on the app will be deleted.

### Grid Deletion

If there is a grid configured on the SyncServer, 
and the grid on the app has been deleted with the security pin and a new grid has been initialised, 
the SyncServer must be prepared to receive the new grid from the app.

A specific url has to be called on the server and the admin token has to be provided.

The following `curl` command can be used to reset the grid on the SyncServer:
```
curl -X DELETE -H "Authorization:  Bearer <token>" http://192.168.73.23/grid
```

`<token>` needs to be replaced by the `base64` encoded `adminToken` that is specified also in the
SyncServer `application.yaml` file.

The example `application.yaml` is provided in the [upgrade instructions](UPGRADE.md).

The encoded token for the default admin token is `MDEyMzQ1Njc4OWFiY2RlZg==`.

## Known issues
